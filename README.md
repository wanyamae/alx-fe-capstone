## Stepwise Approach

1. **Project Initialization**
	- Set up project using Vite, React, and TypeScript.
	- Initialized git repository and created base folder structure.

2. **Styling Setup**
	- Installed and configured TailwindCSS for utility-first styling.
	- Customized global styles and responsive layout.

3. **State Management**
	- Installed Redux and Redux Toolkit for global state management.
	- Created slices for UI state (e.g., mobile navbar toggle).

4. **Component Structure**
	- Built reusable components: Sidebar, MobileNavbar, Footer.
	- Implemented responsive navigation (sidebar for desktop, dropdown for mobile).

5. **API Integration**
	- Installed Axios for HTTP requests (to be used for quiz data, etc.).

6. **Icons and UI Enhancements**
	- Added Heroicons for navigation and UI icons.

7. **Testing and Linting**
	- Configured ESLint and TypeScript for code quality.

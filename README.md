#### üóìÔ∏è Week 2 Progress

- **Quiz API Integration:**
	- Set up API calls to fetch quiz questions and categories from OpenTDB.
	- Created `opentdb.ts` and `opentdbCategories.ts` in `src/api/` for modular API logic.
	- Wired up quiz start to use real API data (not just local `data.json`).

	- Built out `Login` and `LoginForm` components (UI, validation, Redux wiring).
	- Added `RequireAuth` wrapper for protected routes (basic version).

- **Dashboard Enhancements:**
	- Improved `HomeDashboard` and `UserDashboard` with more stats and charts.
	- Added `PerformanceChart` for quiz analytics (dummy data for now).

- **Quiz Review/Feedback Prep:**
	- Started groundwork for quiz review feature (UI placeholders, Redux slice updates).

- **General Fixes & Refactoring:**
	- Cleaned up folder structure for clarity (moved/renamed some components).
	- Improved TypeScript types in `interface/`.
	- Minor UI polish and bugfixes across the board.
